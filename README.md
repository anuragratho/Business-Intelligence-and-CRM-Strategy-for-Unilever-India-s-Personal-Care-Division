rural regions. Despite promotional campaigns and a wide product range, certain products have
shown inconsistent sales volumes, and stock inefficiencies have led to supply-demand
mismatches. Furthermore, there is a lack of centralized visibility into how promotions affect
different regions and whether inventory lead times are optimized.

and supply chain inefficiencies in Unilever India's Personal Care Division, and how can a CRM
solution be integrated to improve customer engagement and operational performance?

# Business Goals
 Identify trends in product sales across different regions
 Measure the impact of promotions on sales performance
 Analyze stock levels in relation to replenishment efficiency
 Segment store locations based on performance
 Implement CRM features to track campaigns, complaints, and retention
 Visualize business insights using Power BI dashboards

sales across urban, rural, and suburban stores.
